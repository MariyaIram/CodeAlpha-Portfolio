The Portfolio project we created today is a personal website that showcases your skills, experience, and projects.

HTML: Creates the structure of the website, including sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact."
CSS: Styles the website to make it visually appealing, adding colors, fonts, and layout design.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, like smooth scrolling between sections and showing more details about projects when clicked.
This portfolio serves as an online resume, where you can display your work and share it with others.
